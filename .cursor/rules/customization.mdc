# CursorRIPER Framework - Customization
# Version 1.0.1

## AI PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
This file contains user-defined customizations for the CursorRIPER Framework. As an AI assistant, you MUST:
- Load this file after core framework components if it exists
- Apply these customizations to override default framework behavior
- Never modify this file unless explicitly requested by the user
- Acknowledge the active customizations in your first response of each session

## USER PREFERENCES

### Response Style
RESPONSE_VERBOSITY: "BALANCED"
# Possible values: "CONCISE", "BALANCED", "DETAILED"
# Controls the level of detail in AI responses

CODE_STYLE_PREFERENCES: ""
# Specify coding style preferences (indentation, naming conventions, etc.)

EXPLANATION_LEVEL: "MEDIUM"
# Possible values: "MINIMAL", "MEDIUM", "COMPREHENSIVE"
# Controls how much explanation is provided with code

### Mode Behavior
SUGGEST_MODE_TRANSITIONS: true
# If true, AI can suggest when a mode transition might be appropriate

AUTO_MODE_TRANSITION: false
# If true, AI can automatically transition between modes (except to EXECUTE)
# EXECUTE mode always requires explicit user authorization

PLAN_QUESTION_COUNT: 5
# Number of clarifying questions to ask in PLAN mode

### Memory Management
AUTO_UPDATE_MEMORY: true
# If true, AI will automatically update memory files after significant changes

MEMORY_UPDATE_FREQUENCY: "AFTER_COMPLETION"
# Possible values: "AFTER_EVERY_RESPONSE", "AFTER_COMPLETION", "MANUAL_ONLY"
# Controls when memory files are updated

REQUIRED_MEMORY_FILES: ["projectbrief.md", "activeContext.md", "progress.md"]
# List of memory files that must exist for the framework to function

### Archive Behavior
AUTO_ARCHIVE_START_PHASE: true
# If true, START phase will be automatically archived upon completion

BACKUP_FREQUENCY: "DAILY"
# Possible values: "NEVER", "DAILY", "WEEKLY", "BEFORE_CHANGES"
# Controls how often memory bank backups are created

KEEP_BACKUP_COUNT: 5
# Number of backup sets to retain before deleting oldest

## ADVANCED CUSTOMIZATION

### Command Aliases
CUSTOM_COMMANDS: {
  "/r": "/research",
  "/i": "/innovate",
  "/p": "/plan",
  "/e": "/execute",
  "/rev": "/review"
}
# Custom command shortcuts for mode transitions

### Mode Extensions
RESEARCH_MODE_EXTENSIONS: []
# Additional behaviors for RESEARCH mode
1. In RESEARCH mode, if the user's question is not comprehensive enough, you must use the interactive feedback MCP to interact with the user. Only ask about blocking points. If there are none, automatically proceed to INNOVATE mode.

INNOVATE_MODE_EXTENSIONS: []
# Additional behaviors for INNOVATE mode
1. In INNOVATE mode, if necessary, you must use the interactive feedback MCP to interact with the user. After execution, automatically proceed to PLAN mode.

PLAN_MODE_EXTENSIONS: []
# Additional behaviors for PLAN mode
1. In PLAN mode, after execution, use the interactive feedback MCP to ask the user if the plan needs adjustment. If the user responds with a clear indication to proceed to the next phase or an empty message, then proceed to EXECUTE mode. If the user suggests modifications to the plan, re-enter PLAN mode.
2. alwayas make TODO list for your plan

EXECUTE_MODE_EXTENSIONS: []
# Additional behaviors for EXECUTE mode
1. In EXECUTE mode, after execution, use the interactive feedback MCP to ask the user about the execution effect. If the user proposes new modifications that are related to the current task, automatically re-enter EXECUTE mode. If the user's feedback is unrelated to the current task, automatically enter RESEARCH mode to start a new round of task execution.

REVIEW_MODE_EXTENSIONS: []
# Additional behaviors for REVIEW mode

### Framework Extensions
CUSTOM_PHASES: []
# Additional project phases beyond standard ones
1. All interactions with the user must use the interactive feedback MCP. At the end of each phase, the conversation should not end; instead, automatically proceed to the next phase. Only when the user approves ending the session through the interactive feedback MCP, can the conversation be ended.
2. if users response is empty, you should decide on your own.

CUSTOM_WORKFLOWS: []
# Custom workflows for specific project types

## USER DOCUMENTATION PREFERENCES

### Documentation Format
DOCUMENTATION_STYLE: "MARKDOWN"
# Format for generated documentation

INCLUDE_CODE_COMMENTS: true
# Whether to include detailed comments in generated code

CODE_BLOCK_LANGUAGE_TAGS: true
# Whether to include language tags in code blocks

### AI Output Format
MODE_DECLARATION_FORMAT: "[MODE: {mode}]"
# Format string for mode declarations

PROGRESS_INDICATOR_FORMAT: "[{current_step}/{total_steps}]"
# Format for progress indicators in responses

## CUSTOM PROJECT STRUCTURE

PROJECT_TYPE: "DEFAULT"
# Identifies the type of project for specialized handling

CUSTOM_FOLDER_STRUCTURE: {}
# Custom folder structure definitions for project scaffolding

TECHNOLOGY_PRESETS: {}
# Predefined technology stacks for quick selection
